# Technology

Standard sequencing workflows often collapse molecular diversity  
and obscure rare genome editing outcomes.

EditVerity is designed to reveal what standard methods miss.

---

## Why standard sequencing fails

- PCR and conventional NGS convert mismatches into consensus alleles  
- Ultra-rare outcomes are diluted below detection thresholds  
- Complex repair outcomes and rearrangements escape simple readouts  

---

## The EditVerity approach

### 1. Rare outcome enrichment
Improves sensitivity for low-frequency mutations and complex repair products.

### 2. Error suppression
Distinguishes true biological variants from PCR and sequencing artifacts.

### 3. Outcome interpretation
Converts raw sequencing data into actionable, regulatory-relevant insight.

## Applications

- CRISPR/Cas genome editing validation  
- Off-target and unintended outcome analysis  
- IND-enabling safety assessment  
- Mechanistic studies of DNA repair pathways
